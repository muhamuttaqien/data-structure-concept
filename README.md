In computer science, a data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently, which is strongly interrelated with algorithm implementation. Data strucutre is generally based on the ability of a computer to fetch and store data at any place in its memory, specified by a pointer (a bit string, representing a memory address) that can be itself stored in memory and manipulated by the program.

There are numerous types of data structures, in general.

1. Array

As a number of elements in a specific order, typically all of the same type. Elements are accessed using an integer index to specify which element is required.

2. Linked list (also just called list) 

As a linear collection of data elements of any type, called nodes, where each node has itself a value, and points to the next node in the linked list. The principal advantage of a linked list over an array, is that values can always be efficiently inserted and removed without relocating the rest of the list.

3. Record (also called tuple or struct) 

As an aggregate data structure. A record is a value that contains other values, typically in fixed numbet and sequence and typically indexed by names. The elements of records are usually called fields or members.

4. Class 

As a data structure that contains data fields, like a record, as well as various methods which operate on the contents of the record. In the context of OOP (object-oriented programming), records are known as plain old data structures to distinguish them from classes.
