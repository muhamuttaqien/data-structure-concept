# data-structure-concept

In computer science, a data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently, which is strongly interrelated with algorithm implementation. Data strucutre is generally based on the ability of a computer to fetch and store data at any place in its memory, specified by a pointer (a bit string, representing a memory address) that can be itself stored in memory and manipulated by the program.
